  AI 서비스 백엔드 아키텍쳐 설계 및 구축에 기여하고 싶습니다.
  첫 회사를 퇴사한 후 알고리즘에 대해 더 깊이 공부하고자 대학원 진학을 하였습니다. 운전 부주의로 인한 사고를 방지하기 위한 객체 상태 인식(운전자 상태 인식)연구에 가치를 느껴 휴먼컴퓨터인터랙션(HCI) 연구실에 합류하였습니다. 연구에 적용하기 위해 Lasagne/Caffe, Python을 배우며 딥러닝 세계에 접어들게 되었습니다. 
  딥 러닝을 이용하여 이미지 검색, 주가 예측, 화질 개선, 생체 신호 인식 등 다양한 프로젝트를 진행하였지만 아직 대중에게 필요한 서비스를 제공하지 못했다는 갈증이 있습니다.
  사람을 위한 가치, 그리고 그 가치를 위한 기술을 추구하며 개발자로서의 여정을 나아가고 있습니다. 사람들에게 가치를 주는 서비스 개발에 기여하여 발자취를 남기고 싶다는 갈증이 있습니다.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
